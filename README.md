# Sample Flask App

Learning to make post receiver from midtrans

Example of checkout page using Midtrans Snap. A quick and secure way to accept
payment with a beautiful user interface done for you.

This is a very simple, very minimalist example to demonstrate integrating
Midtrans Snap with Flask (Python). To start:

1. Install Python
2. Clone the repository
3. Install flask: `pip install Flask`
4. Install midtrans: `pip install midtransclient`
5. Run the web server using:
   - `python web.py`, or
   - `FLASK_APP=web.py flask run`,

The app will run at port 5000.
